The Great Question Answer Checker

Description

This fun Python program checks whether the user knows “the Answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.” Inspired by The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, it uses Python’s match statement (introduced in Python 3.10) to compare input against the famous answer — 42.



How It Works

The program asks:
    "What is the Answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?"

It takes the user’s input and compares it using a match statement:
    If the input is "42", "Forty Two", or "forty-two" → it prints "Yes"
    Otherwise → it prints "No"
